# Trignometry

Trigonometry is a branch of geometry that is important in fields such as navigation, surveying, engineering, astronomy and architecture. Basic trigonometry is used to find unknown sides and angles in right-angled triangles. The word trigonometry is derived from two Greek words: ‘trigonon’, which means triangle, and ‘metron’, which means measurement. Measurement of unknown sides in right-angled triangles can be found using Pythagoras' theorem. However, this could only be used to find one side when the other two were known.

From Pythagoras’ theorem, we know that the longest side in a right-angled triangle is called the hypotenuse. The other two sides also have names that refer to one of the acute angles in the triangle. The side furthest from the angle is the opposite side, whereas the side next to the angle is the adjacent side.

## Trigonometric Ratios

Each of the right-angled triangles in this diagram (ie AOB, COD, EOF) is similar to the others since the corresponding angles in each are the same. The angle at O is obviously the same for each triangle. The ratios o/h, a/h, o/a are equal in all of the triangles. These ratios are called the trigonometric ratios (abbreviated to trig. ratios) and are given special titles. 

- The ratio o/h (side opposite angle θ / hypotenuses) is called the sine ratio. It is abbreviated to sin θ. 

- The ratio a/h (side adjacent to angle θ / hypotenuses) is called the cosine ratio. It is abbreviated to cos θ. 

- The ratio o/a (side opposite angle θ / side adjacent to angle θ) is called the tangent ratio. It is abbreviated to tan θ. 

The three ratios have constant values for any particular angle irrespective of how big the right-angled triangle may be. For any angle, the values of the ratios can be obtained from a calculator. As the lengths of right-angled triangles can often be surds, many trig. ratios are irrational numbers.

Since o/h ÷ a/h = o/a:

## Using Trigonometric Ratios

If we were to find  sin θ, cos θ and tan θ in the triangle above, this is how we would do it:

We can also use Trigonometric Ratios along with Pythagoras' theorem:

Since the hypotenuse of the triangle is not given, we must first find the hypotenuse using Pythagoras' theorem and then use trigonometric ratios to find sin θ, cos θ and tan θ.

Here is a small hint while calculating sin and cos:

## Using a Calculator to Find Trigonometric Ratios:

As we have already found, the values of the trig. ratios are constant for any particular angle and
these values can be found from a calculator. You can also use the calculator to find an angle when you are given the ratio.

### Finding a Ratio Given the Angle

To find tan 31°, ensure your calculator is operating in ‘degrees’ and then press:
tan 31 = 
The calculator should give tan 31° = 0·600 860 6, correct to 7 decimal places.

#### Degrees and Minutes

So far the angles have all been in whole degrees. One degree, however, can be divided into 60 minutes. For example, 31 ° would equal 31 degrees and 30 minutes. This would be written as 31°30′.

We can convert degrees to minutes by multiplying the number by 60. You can only do this for the fraction part of the number. In order to convert munites to degrees, you divide the number by 60. You may also use the DMS on the calculator to convert from degrees to minutes or from minutes to degrees. If you give a number in degrees and want the answer in minutes, you must press the DMS button after pressing the equal-to button. If you want to give the number in minutes but want the answer in degrees, you must press the DMS button after entering the value in degrees and before entering the value in minutes. Since most calculators don't have the DMS function, it is better to know how to convert minutes and degrees without a calculator.

### Finding an Angle Given the Ratio

You can find an angle given the ratio by applying the inverse operation to the ratio. The inverse operation is shown on a calculator as 2nd F. For example: if sin θ = 0.632, you can find θ by typing in 2nd F sin 0.632 =. The calculator would give you the answer 39.19783353.

### Basic Trignometric Ratios

There are a few trigonometric ratios that are easy to remember. Such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66630745/84346173-004e5380-abcd-11ea-9b5a-2a0c83dac1c9.png)

tan 45 is equal to one because the triangle would be isosceles. If one angle is 45 and another is a right angle, the last angle would be 45 making the triangle isosceles. Since the triangle is isosceles, the sides opposite to and adjacent to the angle would be of the same length. 

## Further Trignometry

### Angle of Depression and Elevation

When looking upwards towards an object, the angle of elevation is defined as the angle between the line of sight and the horizontal. When looking downwards towards an object, the angle of depression is defined as the angle between the line of sight and the horizontal. The angle of depression is the same as the angle of elevation.

Let's suppose we have to find the height of h:

h/180= tan 23°

h = (tan 23°) × 180

= 76.405467

Let's take another example where we have to find the angle:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66630745/84347612-a780ba00-abd0-11ea-8909-ac155fa17232.png)

tan θ = 40/650

θ = 2nd F tan 40/650

= 3.5214534

### Compass Bearings

The direction of a point Y from an original point X is known as the bearing of Y from X. This is mainly expressed in one of two ways.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66630745/84347987-8ff60100-abd1-11ea-8e5d-c05798fa19e6.png)

The bearing of Y from X can be given as 150° (the angle between the interval XY and the north line measured in a clockwise direction), or, south 30° east (S30°E). Sometimes, only letters are used. So SE (or south-east) is halfway between south (180°) and east (90°); that is, 135° or S45°F.

Other examples include:

If you were to find angle QPR from the image above you would have to find angle NPR and angle NPQ and then subtract angle NPQ from NPR. The same subtraction method goes for finding QR. You would have to subtract NR from NQ in order to get the length of QR.
